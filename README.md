Submission for Hackpad.
This is a simple macropad built of 5 switches and 2 LEDs.
The switches are arranged in a row to allow quick and comfortable button presses.

The keys currently just type basic letters, as I made this to get experience with PCB and electronic design.
The PCB fits in the case below the top and will allow the buttons to be easily pressed.

Features:

- 5 Mechanical Switches
- 2 SK6812 Mini RGB LEDs

BOM:

- 5x Cherry MX Switches
- 5x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 2x SK6812 MINI LEDs
- XIAO RP2040
- 3d Printed Case (Top and Bottom)
- 4x Bolts

The schematic and PCB were made in KiCad, and the case was built in Fusion.

## Schematic

## PCB

![PCB](https://github.com/arnavthapar/arnavs-macropad/blob/main/assets/pcb.png)

The dimensions of the PCB are 99.25 mm by 44.25 mm.

## Case

![Case](https://github.com/arnavthapar/arnavs-macropad/blob/main/assets/case.png)

The case has 5 cutouts for the keys and 2 smaller holes for the LED light to shine through. The large cutout on the bottom right is for the XIAO RP2040.

## Assembly

Assembling this is very easy.
Once the case is 3D printed, you can just slot in the PCB and bolt in the top; it should be instantly usable.
