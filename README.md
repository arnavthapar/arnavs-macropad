# Arnav's Macropad

Submission for Hackpad.
This is a simple macropad built of 5 switches and 2 LEDs.
The switches are arranged in a row to allow quick and comfortable button presses.

The keys do not really do much important, as they just type some letters. I mostly made this just to get experience with working with electronics. Currently, the firmware uses KMK.

The PCB fits in the case and should hopefully allow the buttons to be pressed.

Features:

- 5 Mechanical Switches
- 2 SK6812 Mini RGB LEDs

BOM:

- 5x Cherry MX Switches
- 5x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 2x SK6812 MINI LEDs
- XIAO RP2040
- 3d Printed Case (Top and Bottom)
- 4x Bolts

The schematic and PCB were made in KiCAD, and the case was built in Fusion.

The dimensions of the PCB are 99.25 mm by 44.25 mm.

## Case

The case has 5 cutouts for the keys and 2 smaller holes for the LED light to shine through. The large cutout on the bottom right is for the XIAO RP2040.
