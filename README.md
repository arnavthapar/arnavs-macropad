# Arnav's Macropad

Submssion for hackpad.
This is a simple macropad built of 5 switches and 2 LEDs.
The switches are arranged in a row to allow quicker buttons presses.

The PCB fits in the case and should hopefully allow the buttons to be pressed.

Features:

- 5 Switches
- 2 LEDs

BOM:

- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 2x SK6812 MINI Leds
- XIAO RP2040
- Case (Top and Bottom)
- 4x Bolts

The schematic and PCB were made in KiCAD, and the case was built in Fusion.
